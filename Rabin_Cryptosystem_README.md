# Rabin Cryptosystem and Zero-Knowledge Attack

## Description
This project implements the Rabin cryptosystem and conducts an attack on a zero-knowledge proof protocol. It showcases cryptographic operations such as key generation, encryption, decryption, and signature validation. The attack highlights vulnerabilities in proving modular factorization knowledge without revealing secrets.

## Contents
- **Implementation**:
  - Key generation for the Rabin cryptosystem.
  - Encryption and decryption processes.
  - Digital signature creation and verification.
- **Attack Simulation**:
  - Exploiting zero-knowledge proof protocol vulnerabilities.
  - Factorizing the modulus using a random challenge-based attack.
  
## Features
1. Implements the Rabin cryptosystem with extended functionality.
2. Simulates a zero-knowledge proof protocol attack.
3. Verifies operations with an external test service.
4. Demonstrates the weaknesses of the protocol.

## Usage
1. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python AsymCryptoLab3-Python-2023-Marynin_fi94-Nemkovych_fi-94.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Generate keys.
   - Encrypt and decrypt messages.
   - Create and verify signatures.
   - Perform an attack on a zero-knowledge proof protocol.
